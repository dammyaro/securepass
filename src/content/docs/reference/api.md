# API Reference

Welcome to the SecurePass API Reference. This page provides an overview of the available API endpoints and their usage within the SecurePass application.

## Overview

SecurePass is primarily a client-side application for generating secure passwords. However, if you plan to extend SecurePass with backend features or integrations, you can document your API endpoints here.

## Example Endpoints

### 1. Generate Password (Client-Side)

> **Note:** Password generation is handled entirely in the browser using JavaScript. There is no backend API for password generation in the default SecurePass app.

### 2. Planned/Example API Endpoints

If you add backend features, document them here. For example:

#### `POST /api/generate`
Generate a secure password on the server (example endpoint).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "length": 16,
  "includeSymbols": true,
  "includeNumbers": true
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "password": "A1b2C3d4E5f6G7h8"
}
```

#### `GET /api/health`
Check the health status of the SecurePass backend (example endpoint).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```
